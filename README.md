# Math-Go

**Math-Go** is a beginner-friendly math quiz program developed using Golang. It generates random math problems and allows users to practice basic addition through a simple quiz interface. This project is aimed at helping beginners understand basic Golang syntax while having fun solving math problems.   

**Warning:** This project is intended for educational purposes only. It is referenced from [Kuis Matematika](https://github.com/luhur65/kuis-matematika) made with Python.

## Features
- Simple interactive command-line quiz
- Randomly generated math problems (addition only)
- Tracks user input and provides feedback (correct/incorrect answers)
- Beginner-friendly Golang code

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/math-go.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd math-go
    ```

3. Run the program:
    ```bash
    go run main.go

Math Quiz By Golang Welcome, John

7 + 3 = Jawaban : 10 Benar!
5 + 9 = Jawaban : 12 Salah! Jawaban benar = 14
```

## Goals

- Teach basic Go syntax (variables, functions, loops, user input, and random number generation).
- Provide a fun way to practice math skills.
- Serve as a starting point for more complex quiz applications.

## Future Improvements

- Add support for subtraction, multiplication, and division questions.
- Implement a scoring system.
- Allow users to set the difficulty level.
